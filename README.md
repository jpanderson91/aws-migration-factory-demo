aws configure sso --profile aws-migration-factory-demo
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile aws-migration-factory-demo
```

### Deploy Infrastructure (8-10 minutes)
```powershell
# Clone and deploy
git clone https://github.com/jpanderson91/aws-migration-factory-demo.git
cd aws-migration-factory-demo/terraform

# Initialize and deploy
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Verify deployment
aws mgn describe-source-servers --profile aws-migration-factory-demo
aws migrationhub describe-application-state --profile aws-migration-factory-demo
```

### Test the System
```powershell
# Generate test migration data
cd ../testing
python test_migration_factory.py

# View live dashboards (URLs from terraform output)
terraform output dashboard_urls
```

**Expected Results:**
